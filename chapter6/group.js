/** GROUP
 * Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). 
 * Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its constructor 
 * creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group (but only 
 * if it isnâ€™t already a member), delete removes its argument 
 * from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean 
 * value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.
 * Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, 
 * to determine whether two values are the same.
 * Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable 
 * object as argument and creates a group that contains all the 
 * values produced by iterating over it.
